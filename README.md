Example project repo

In the README file you should explain what the project is about

This is an example project repository for the STAMPS 2018 projects.

It has a few directories

- data (where you can put your data, or if you're not sharing the data have
a file that describes the data)
- reports (the reports that you want to share)

In the top level (here) you can put the code for the project.
